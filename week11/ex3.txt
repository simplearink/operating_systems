After task 2 after \n the text is printed and line buffer is emptied.

The first program holds "Hello" in a line buffer and after fork() call parent 
and child processes hold that "Hello" in their buffers. After \n the text is
printed and each buffer is emptied. So there are two prints "Hello". 

The second program prints "Hello" before fork() call, so after fork() we
have nothing in buffer. So "Hello" is printed only once
