1) Avoidance is a good strategy, because it is always better to avoid rather
than fix problem. But avoidance requires some special information in advance.

If there's no such information, we can use one of two other stratagies:
prevention or recovery.

2) Prevention seems better to me: as I mentioned, it is always better to
prevent problem. Prevention is used when we can "attack" at least one of
four conditions:
- Mutual-Exclusion
- Hold-and-Wait
- No-Preemption
- Circular wait

3) If we cannot prevent, we need to fix. Here recovery is used.
